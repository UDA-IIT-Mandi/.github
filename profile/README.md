# UDA-IIT-Mandi Organization

## Overview

This GitHub organization contains repositories related to research projects conducted during internship at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Mandi under the School of Computing and Electrical Engineering. Our research focuses on various techniques for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA), with a particular emphasis on adapting these methods to work effectively with audio data.

## Research Focus

Our team is working under the guidance of Dr. Padmanabhan Rajan, exploring novel approaches to domain adaptation challenges. The primary research areas include:

- Unsupervised Domain Adaptation techniques
- Audio scene classification
- Transfer learning across different domains
- Feature extraction methods for audio data

## Repositories

### [Unsupervised-Domain-Adaptation-Learning](https://github.com/UDA-IIT-Mandi/Unsupervised-Domain-Adaptation-Learning)

This repository contains implementations of unsupervised domain adaptation techniques using Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL) and PaSST feature extractors across various datasets. The code was collected and modified from various GitHub sources as a learning exercise and precursor to our main research project.


### [UDA-Cycle-Self-Training](https://github.com/UDA-IIT-Mandi/UDA-Cycle-Self-Training)

A PyTorch implementation of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation using Cycle Self-Training (CST) adapted for computer vision tasks, with future extensions planned for audio scene classification using the DCASE TAU 2020 dataset with PaSST feature extractors.

**Key Technologies:**
- Python
- PyTorch
- Cycle Self-Training (CST)
- DCASE TAU 2020 dataset
- Jupyter Notebooks
